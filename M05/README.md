# Problem M05: Matrix Transposition
Given a matrix *m* × *n* (*m* and *n* do not exceed 1000). An array that is symmetric to it with respect to the main diagonal is called transposed to the given one. It has dimensions *n* × *m*: the rows of the original array become the columns of the transposed one, the columns of the original array become the rows of the transposed one.

For the given array, construct the transposed array and display it on the screen.

**Output format:** Each element is separated by **one space** character. Last printed character is an **endline**.
